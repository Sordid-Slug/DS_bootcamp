We have made 12 observations from tossing a coin: 7 of them were tails and 5 of
them were heads. The probabilities are 41.67% and 58.33%, respectively. Our
forecast is that in the next 5 observations we will have: 7 tail and 5 heads.

We have made 12 observations from tossing a coin: 7 of them were tails and 5 of
them were heads. The probabilities are 41.67% and 58.33%, respectively. Our
forecast is that in the next 5 observations we will have: 7 tail and 5 heads.
